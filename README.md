# Data-Analysis-for-Hospitals

An introduction to Pandas and Matplotlib to manipulate data from 3 hospitals, clean that data and merged it into one DataSet.

And be able to get some insights and information through plots. To answer questions like these:

 1- Which hospital has the highest number of patients?
 
 2- What share of the patients in a specific hospital suffers from stomach-related issues (or any other issue)?
 
 3- What share of the patients in a specific hospital suffers from dislocation-related issues (or any other issue)?
 
 4- What is the difference in the median ages of the patients in different hospitals?
 
 5- In which hospital the blood test was taken the most often? How many blood tests were taken?
 
 6- What is the most common age of a patient among all hospitals?

 8- Build a violin plot of height distribution by hospitals. Try to answer the questions:
 
    a- What is the main reason for the gap in values?
    
    b- Why there are two peaks, which correspond to the relatively small and big values?
